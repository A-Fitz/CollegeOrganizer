# College Organizer
WIP Android Application built in Java. Supposed to act as a all-in-one organizer app for college students. 

Students can enter their class schedule and it will be added to the calendar as well as their gradebook. They can then enter their grades for certain assignments. They can also schedule social activities, physical activities, and meal times. Students can record their diet, sleep time/quality, and mood. 

All of this data is stored and can be analyzed together in a very unique way. The data comparison section of the app contains presets, and a way to create presets, to compare any data points the app stores. For example, a student can analyze the correlation between their time sleeping and average grade on Mondays, their mood compared to their diet, or their social activeness to their caloric intake. Custom graphs can also be made for any data points.

These features have already been mostly implemented, but are not bug free. The application will one day integrate with popular calendar services such as Google Calendar and/or Microsoft Office Calendar. It will also connect with Google Fit and devices such as a FitBit or smartwatches running WearOS.

It is being developed and researched alongside UW-Platteville student Ross Baldwin and Dr. Suboh Alkushayni.
